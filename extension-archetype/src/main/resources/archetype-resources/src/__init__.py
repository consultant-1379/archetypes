 src/__init__.py

 This directory is not really a Python package, but this file
 is required by our build system.  It allows us to run "nosetests ./src"
 without having to list each package separately.

 This file will not be included in any RPM built from this repo,
 thanks to an <exclude> tag in the integration POM.
